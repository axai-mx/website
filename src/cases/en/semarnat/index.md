<p>We migrated all the content from the previous web platform based on Sharepoint to Drupal 7, thus allowing better control and categorization of over 14,000 existing documents.<br><br> The current site allows a very precise definition of the roles and permissions of users by facilitating the process of publishing content that is uploaded to the portal. It also shows the graphical style aligned with the current directives of mexican government sites.</p>
