<p>We created an open source, native, cross platform application for iOS and Android, using Xamarin to compile the code written in C#, the app can be downloaded from the respective mobile stores for each platform.</p><p>We configured Drupal and Solr in order to set up the web services that talk to the application, a guide through the process can be found in our <a href="/en/node/29">blog section</a>.</p><p>Since this application is open source, the code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/g3r4/Axai-app-XamarinForms">Github</a>, you will need to have Xamarin in order to compile it.</p>
