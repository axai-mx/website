<p>We helped optimize the performance of the city webpage at the end of 2011 and beginnings of 2012. The website was developed by another software provider.</p><p>We were in charge of optimizing the configuration for apache to reduce memory consumption, of PHP to better leverage the opcode cache and finally correctly configuring Drupal. The website went from 27 request per second to 1,114.</p>
